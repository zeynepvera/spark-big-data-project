# Big Data Course Project

This repository contains my course project covering **MapReduce**, **Machine Learning applications**, and **Advanced SQL queries**.  
The project focuses on customer churn analysis and big data processing concepts.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project consists of three main components required by the course:

1. **One MapReduce Algorithm**
2. **Two Machine Learning Applications**
3. **Advanced SQL Queries integrated into the analysis**

All implementations are supported with explanations and visual results in the final report.

## 🗂️ Dataset

- **Churn_Modelling.csv**
- The dataset contains customer information such as:
  - Credit score
  - Geography
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Balance
  - Estimated salary
  - Churn status (Exited)

The main goal is to analyze customer behavior and predict churn.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Applications

Two different machine learning approaches are applied on the dataset:

### 1️⃣ Customer Churn Prediction (Classification)
- The churn variable (`Exited`) is predicted using supervised learning.
- Models are trained, tested, and evaluated.
- Performance metrics and visualizations are used to interpret results.

### 2️⃣ Model Comparison & Evaluation
- Different machine learning models are compared to analyze performance differences.
- Results are visualized using plots (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.).
- Interpretations are provided in the report without code-level explanations.

📊 **All results are presented with plots and explained in the PDF report.**

## 🗺️ MapReduce Component

- A MapReduce algorithm is implemented to demonstrate distributed data processing.
- The algorithm processes large-scale data by applying:
  - Mapping phase
  - Shuffling and sorting
  - Reducing phase
- The purpose is to show how big data can be efficiently processed using MapReduce concepts.

## 🗄️ SQL Component

At least **two advanced SQL queries** are used, including:
- Aggregations
- Filtering
- Grouping
- Subqueries

These queries are designed to extract meaningful insights from customer data and support the analysis.
